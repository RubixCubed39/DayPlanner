## Overview

This project had us make a Day Planner for standard buisness hours, as in 9am to 5pm. On the planner, it would have the current day at the top along with time blocks for that day. Once you had input what you needed to do for a specific time block, you could save it and it would be saved onto the local storage so that if you were to leave the page and come back to it, your saved time block would persist.

## Usage

Select a time block you wish to input a task. Once you click on the time block, you can input whatever your heart desires into the field provided then click the save icon to save it. If you wish to clear a time block, simply clear out the block and then save again.
